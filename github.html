                        Github is an online sharing and collaboration tool. 
                        We knew little of what github did or how it could impact a project. 
                        In this article we will tell you about our experience with github.

                        Trials and tribulations

                        Looking at this project was daunting. We had never worked on making a website with other people before. 
                        Would we be able to make a website without messing up eachothers work? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we first started using github, it felt a little clunky and rough. 
                        However, after some time had past we started getting the hang of it. 
                        It felt easier and easier working with eachother, and our workflow became efficient. 
                        We did not have to worry about messing up others code. Github solved all those problems for us. 
                        It was more like a gentle mountain river, rather than the onslaught of the seven seas that we were expecting.

                                With it handling all of the merging of documents, it took most of the worry of deleting or messing up 
                                others code out of our heads.

                                It made code management fool proof, which helped manage our parts of the project, while also 
                                allowing us to see and help everyone else.

                        Did we enjoy using github?

                    <p> 
                        As a first-time user github was at large a wonderful experience. 
                        While there were some difficulties when starting out, most of them got solved by just fooling around with the repository. 
                        All in all, github was a huge help for us, and we won't forget that.
